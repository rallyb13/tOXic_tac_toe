1. Create player 1 & 2 #DONE#
2. Define each player as X or O #DONE#
3. Create a space for player to move on to #DONE#
4. Create a board to store spaces
5. Store coordinates of space that player moved on to/push to array
6. Compare array for each player with arrays of winning combos

We have a method to create & return (all) spaces. But it might turn out to be easier, at the Board level to simply make a hash of it that contains all the spaces already made.

VERY NEXT STEP: mark as an attribute of space (in attr)
